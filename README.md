# Etch-A-Sketch

This project is part the The Odin Project curriculum (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)

2nd project as an exercise for The Odin Project. A web version of the
“Etch A Sketch” drawing toy, much more focused on the use of DOM
TOOLS with JavaScript, also more in-depth in HTML and CSS, above all, it
helped me to learn and internalize in CSS grid and flex-box.
